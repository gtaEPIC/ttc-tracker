## Assets
This bot uses emotes to improve the look of the alerts.
You can use whatever you want for these, but it needs to be something.

## Usage
### Service Alerts
The bot will automatically post an embed into the channel specified in the .env file when any service alerts from the TTC that are active.<br>
This embed will be automatically updated every 30 seconds to reflect any changes to the alerts.<br>
If some of the fields contain too much information, it will be moved to an external embed with each alert being a field.<br>
For each alert, the embed will be formatted as so:
- Light Emote: The colour of the alert, flashing if it was reported by a discord member
- Line number: The line number of the alert, if its 1-4 it will try to use the emote
- Description: The description of the alert
- Light Emote: The colour of the alert, flashing offset if it was reported by a discord member
- Author: The author of the alert, if it was reported by a discord member it will be their discord name, if it's from the TTC it will be "AUTO"

### NTAS (Next Train Arrival System)
When the `/ntas <station>` command is used, the bot will reply with an embed containing the NTAS information for the station specified.<br>
Currently, only Line 2 is supported, but line 1 and 4 will be added in the future.<br>
The embed is updated every 20 seconds, for 10 minutes before it stops updating.<br>
The embed will be formatted as so:
- Title: Title of the embed

- Each field will contain:
  - Line: The line number
  - Direction: The direction of the train
  - Destination: The destination of the train
  - Time: The time until the next 3 trains arrive.
- Update button: Will update the embed with the latest information. *Supposed to force an update for a message that stopped updating, but it isn't working.*
